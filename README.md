## Building

Currently this project is only available on Visual Studio.
Clone this repo. Open HW2_424.sln with Visual Studio.
Ensure that HW2_424 is set as the startup project.
Build the HW2_424 Project. The built executable is located in
the `build\<CONFIG>-<PLATFORM>\bin\` directory. If you want to
move this file ensure to move `SDL2.dll` and `map.bmp` with it.
